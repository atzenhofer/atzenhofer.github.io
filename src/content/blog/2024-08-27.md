# Mini CV
I wear many hats in DiDip (didip.eu), e.g., of data analytics, machine learning, DevOps for historical document analysis systems. I also coordinate and help with infrastructure efforts in DHInfra (dhinfra.at), including a specialized GPU cluster for humanities computing. I hold a BEd in German and English, with my thesis on learner corpora; a MA in Digital Humanities, with my thesis on text similarity - both from the University of Graz. I am also a PhD candidate at the Institute of Interactive Systems and Data Science (Technical University of Graz), where I do research on recommender systems and ranking in digital humanities and cultural heritage contexts.
